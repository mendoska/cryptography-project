# How To Use

This is a web app that simulates a Hybrid Cryptographic scheme, a combination of symmetric-key and asymmetric-key encryption. The user is prompted to enter a message they want to send to a recipient. Once the message is sent, there is a "next" button that when pressed will display the order of the operation step by step.
